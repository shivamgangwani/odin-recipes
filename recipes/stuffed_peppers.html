        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, 
            place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the rice is tender, about 40 minutes; 
            transfer to a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>   
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break ground beef into small pieces and place
            in the skillet. Add onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until the beef is completely 
            browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix beef mixture into brown rice.
        </li>
        <li>   
            Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning into the rice mixture
             and season filling with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>   
            Arrange bell peppers in a baking dish. Spoon filling into bell peppers.
        </li>
        <li>   
            Bake in preheated oven until the peppers are tender, about 1 hour. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the stuffed peppers to serve.
